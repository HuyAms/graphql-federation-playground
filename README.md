# GraphQL Fedration

You will work in three main folders:

- `router`
- `subgraph-locations`
- `subgraph-reviews`

# Schema and Queries

**Schema**

```graphql
type Query {
  latestReviews: [Review!]!
  locations: [Location!]!
  location(id: ID!): Location
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  comment: String
  rating: Int
  ðŸ‘‰ location: Location // location
}

type Location {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String!
  photo: String!
  ðŸ‘‰ reviewsForLocation: [Review]! //review
  ðŸ‘‰ overallRating: Float //review
}
```

**Queries**

Get all locations for the homepage.

```graphql
query getAllLocations {
  locations {
    id
    name
    photo
    description
    overallRating
  }
}
```

Get the latest reviews for the homepage.

```graphql
query LatestReviews {
  latestReviews {
    comment
    rating
    location {
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```

Get details for a specific location.

```graphql
query getLocationDetails {
  location(id: "loc-1") {
    id
    name
    description
    photo
    overallRating
    reviews {
      comment
      rating
    }
  }
}
```

Submit a review for a location.

```graphql
mutation submitReview {
  submitReview(review: {comment: "Wow, such a great planet!", rating: 5, locationId: "1"}) {
    code
    success
    message
    review {
      id
      comment
      rating
    }
  }
}
```

# Rover

We can use it to run checks, publish schemas to the schema registy and much more

## Publish Subgraph

```sh
rover subgraph publish <APOLLO_GRAPH_REF> \
  --name <SUBGRAPH NAME> \
  --schema <SCHEMA FILE PATH> \
  --routing-url <ROUTING URL>
```

Example of publishing the location graph

```sh
rover subgraph publish <APOLLO_GRAPH_REF> \
  --name locations \
  --schema ./subgraph-locations/locations.graphql \
  --routing-url http://localhost:4001
```

Example of publishing the reviews graph

```sh
rover subgraph publish Huy-flyby@current \
  --name reviews \
  --schema ./subgraph-reviews/reviews.graphql \
  --routing-url http://localhost:4002
```

Now we should see changes reflected in GraphOS. It only composes the supergraph and reads data from it â€” it doesn't run a server. To serve the supergraph, we need **a Router**.

## Schema Check

```sh
rover subgraph check <GRAPH_REF> \
  --schema <SCHEMA_FILE_PATH> \
  --name <SUBGRAPH_NAME>
```

Example

```sh
rover subgraph check Huy-flyby@current \
  --schema ./subgraph-reviews/reviews.graphql \
  --name reviews
```

Or we can instrospect

```sh
rover subgraph introspect http://localhost:4002 \
  | rover subgraph check Huy-flyby@current \
  --schema - --name reviews
```

## Rover Dev

Composes all subgraphs defined in the `supergraph-config`

```sh
rover dev --supergraph-config ./router/supergraph-config.yaml \
   --router-config ./router/router-config.yaml
```

Starting a session from a GraphOS Studio variant

```sh
rover dev \
  --graph-ref Huy-flyby@current \
  --supergraph-config ./router/supergraph-config.yaml \
  --router-config ./router/router-config.yaml
```

# Router

## Download Router

Firstly, navigate to the **router** folder

```sh
curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/v1.46.0 | sh
```

## Running

```sh
APOLLO_KEY=<YOUR-KEY>
APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=<YOUR-ROUTER-REF> ./router
```

# Migrating to subgraph

Need to add 2 things

1. Import Federation schema
2. Update ApolloServer instance

```js
// subgraph-locations/locations.graphql
extend schema
  @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.7",
        import: ["@key"])

// npm install @apollo/subgraph
// index.js
const { buildSubgraphSchema } = require("@apollo/subgraph");

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});
```

Flow to build a subgraph

1. BE devs design and build subgraphs
2. Someone creates a new supergraph in GraphOS Studio
3. BE devs publish subgraph schemas to the schema registry
4. Schema Registry cmoposes subgraph into **supergraph schema**, makes it available via **Apollo Uplink**
5. The router automatically polls Uplink for any new versions of the supergraph schema

# Entity

## What is an Entity?

Itâ€™s an object that is shared between subgraphs. Each subgraph can contribute fields to that object.

In our case, the Location is shared between subgraphs so itâ€™s an Entity.

```graph
type Location {
  id: ID! // location
  name: String!  // location
  description: String!  // location
  photo: String!  // location
  ðŸ‘‰ reviewsForLocation: [Review]! // review
  ðŸ‘‰ overallRating: Float // review
}
```

A subgraph can

1. Reference an entity - meaning using it as a return type
2. Contribute to an entity

Example

```
// reference an entity
Review {
 id: String,
 location: Location // Location as return type
}

// contribute to an entity
type Location {
  ...
  ðŸ‘‰ reviewsForLocation: [Review]! // review
  ðŸ‘‰ overallRating: Float // review
}
```

## Create an Entity

To create an Entity, we need to

1. Define a **primary key**
2. Define **reference resolver** - responsible for returning all of the entity fields that this subgraph contributes

Example

```ts
// location-subgraph
type Location @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  "The name of the location"
  name: String!
  "A short description about the location"
  description: String!
  "The location's main photo as a URL"
  photo: String!
}

// review subgraph
// resolvable: false meaning there is no reference resolver yet
// and we don't contribute any fields
// it needs to define the entity here in order to use the Location type
type Location @key(fields: "id", resolvable: false) {
  id: ID!
}
```

## Entity Represenetation

Itâ€™s an object that Router uses to represent a specific entity. It contains a **\_\_typename** and the **@key** field. It's sent to a supgraph and a subgraph needs to resolve it.

Example of an Entity that a router sends to a subgraph

```
{
  "__typename": "Location",
  "id": "loc-2"
}
```

## How Router resolves an Entity

Letâ€™s say we have this query that resolves the **Review[]** type

```graphql
query GetLatestReviews {
  latestReviews {
    id //review
    comment //review
    rating //review
    location { //? entity
      name
    }
  }
}
```

1. **Build a query plan**

   - Resolve fields from the **reviews** subgraph as usual.
   - When reaching `location.name`, which can't be resolved directly:
     - **reviews** returns a Location entity reference (`__typename` + key).
     - The router adds a step to the plan to fetch `location.name` from the **location** subgraph.

2. **Query the `reviews` subgraph**
   - Resolve all available fields normally.
   - Include the Location entity reference in the response.
